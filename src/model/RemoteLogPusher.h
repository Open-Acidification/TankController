/*
 * @brief RemoteLogPusher is a singleton that sends data records and remote logs to the server.
 *
 * The server is expected to be running extras/log_file_server.
 * The ideas is that while the device records data to the SD card's 1-second log and
 * 1-minute log, it also sends the 1-minute log records to the server with configuration
 * changes and certain warning and error conditions.
 *
 * Eventually, the server will send remote logs to a user's phone.
 *
 * The device tries to keep the server up-to-date on the latest data by comparing the
 * file size reported by the server (in a HEAD request) with the file size on the SD card.
 * If the server has a smaller file, the device sends data from the indicated point to the
 * end of the file.
 *
 * The instance is called each time through the TankController's loop() and operates
 * with a state machine.
 *
 * If the state is CLIENT_NOT_CONNECTED and there is new data (indicated by the
 * _shouldSendHeadRequest flag), it sends a HEAD request and changes the state to
 * PROCESS_HEAD_RESPONSE.
 *
 * If the state is PROCESS_HEAD_RESPONSE, it reads the response from the server and if it
 * is a 404, it transitions to the CLIENT_NOT_CONNECTED state and sets a _isReadyToPost flag.
 * If the response is a 200, it transitions to the CLIENT_NOT_CONNECTED state and sets a
 * _isReadyToPost flag if the reported file size is less than the file size on the SD card.
 *
 * If the state is CLIENT_NOT_CONNECTED and there is a _isReadyToPost flag, reads from the
 * SD card and sends a POST request and changes the state to PROCESS_POST_RESPONSE.
 *
 * If the state is PROCESS_POST_RESPONSE, it reads the response from the server and if it
 * a 200, it transitions to the CLIENT_NOT_CONNECTED state and sets a _shouldSendHeadRequest
 * flag to see if there is more that should be sent.
